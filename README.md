# Memory Sequence Game

This is a simple yet engaging memory sequence game built with Pygame. The objective of the game is to test and improve your memory skills by requiring you to remember and replicate a sequence of highlighted buttons. Each correct sequence increases the difficulty by extending the sequence and reducing the time you have to view it.

## Features

- **Progressive Difficulty:** The game becomes faster and the sequences longer with each correct round you complete.
- **Score Tracking:** Your score increases with each successful round, and your high score is saved throughout the session.
- **Immediate Feedback:** The game provides immediate feedback by ending the game as soon as a wrong button is pressed.
- **Restart Capability:** Easily restart the game at any time by pressing the 'Space' bar, allowing for quick retries.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the game, make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. Python 3.x is recommended. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
